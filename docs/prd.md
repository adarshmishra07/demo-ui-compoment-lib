# ZyFAi Component Library - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create a reusable React component library inspired by ZyFAi's glassmorphism design system
- Publish to npm for easy installation and use in crypto/DeFi projects
- Provide 5 core components: Button, Card, Modal, Alert, Toast
- Include comprehensive TypeScript support and Storybook documentation
- Improve upon original design's accessibility issues

### Background Context

This component library addresses the gap in available glassmorphism UI components for crypto/DeFi applications. While ZyFAi's interface is visually appealing, it has accessibility issues that this library will resolve. The library will serve as both a demonstration piece and a practical tool for developers building similar interfaces.

- **NFR3**: Bundle size should remain under 50KB when tree-shaken
- **NFR4**: Components must work with React 16.8+ and support modern bundlers
- **NFR5**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations and transitions

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Clean, modern glassmorphism interface that maintains the sophisticated feel of crypto/DeFi applications while being accessible to all users.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- Hover states with subtle opacity and blur changes
- Glass morphism effects using backdrop-filter CSS
- Smooth transitions respecting motion preferences
- Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation

### Core Screens and Views

- Storybook documentation site with interactive component playground
- npm package page with installation and usage examples

### Accessibility

**Standard**: WCAG AA - All components will meet WCAG AA standards with proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### Branding

Dark glassmorphism theme inspired by ZyFAi with blue accent color (hsla(230, 100%, 67%, 1)) and multiple dark background layers creating depth and visual hierarchy.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Components will work across desktop and mobile devices with responsive design patterns.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single repository containing source code, Storybook documentation, and build configuration.

### Service Architecture

Component library package - no backend services required. Static documentation site hosted via GitHub Pages or similar.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration + Visual Testing** - Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library, visual regression testing via Storybook, accessibility testing with axe-core.

### Additional Technical Assumptions

- React 18+ for development but compatible with 16.8+
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- CSS Modules with CSS custom properties for theming
- Tailwind CSS for utility classes and responsive design
