ZyFAi Component Library - Landing Page Design Plan
Overview
A sophisticated landing page showcasing the ZyFAi-inspired component library with interactive 3D elements, glassmorphism effects, and dynamic demonstrations of the available components. The page will serve as both marketing material and live documentation.
Design Architecture
Layout Structure
Hero Section

Full viewport height with 3D animated background using three.js
Floating glassmorphism cards displaying key metrics (similar to ZyFAi's network visualization)
Interactive particle system connecting component nodes
Primary CTA: "Install Library" with secondary "View Documentation"

Component Showcase

Live interactive demos of each component (Button, Card, Modal, Alert, Toast)
Split-screen layout: component preview on left, code snippet on right
Framer Motion animations for smooth transitions between examples
Real-time theme customization controls

Features Grid

Three-column responsive grid highlighting key features
Each card with subtle hover animations and glassmorphism effects
Icons using lucide-react for consistency

Installation Section

Code block with copy functionality
Package manager options (npm, pnpm, yarn)
Quick start guide with live examples

Footer

GitHub links, documentation, and social links
Glassmorphism design consistent with overall theme

Interactive Elements
3D Background (three.js + @react-three/fiber)
jsx// Conceptual structure
<Canvas>
<FloatingNodes /> // Animated 3D spheres representing components
<ConnectionLines /> // Dynamic lines connecting nodes
<OrbitControls enableZoom={false} enablePan={false} />
<Environment preset="night" />
</Canvas>
Particle System (p5.js)

Background particle effect that responds to mouse movement
Particles use ZyFAi color palette with glassmorphism glow effects
Performance-optimized with requestAnimationFrame

Component Demonstrations

Live Button component with all variants cycling automatically
Interactive Card hover states
Modal trigger demonstrations
Toast notifications triggered by user interaction
Alert components showing different states

Visual Design System
Color Palette (ZyFAi Theme)
css--accent: hsla(230, 100%, 67%, 1)
--bg-primary: #121313
--bg-secondary: #141414
--glass-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)
--text-primary: #e4e7e7
Typography Hierarchy

H1: 4rem font-size for hero title
H2: 2.5rem for section headers
H3: 1.75rem for feature titles
Body: 1rem with 1.6 line-height for readability

Glassmorphism Effects

backdrop-filter: blur(16px) for primary glass elements
backdrop-filter: blur(8px) for secondary elements
Subtle border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)
Box-shadow with multiple layers for depth

Responsive Breakpoints
Desktop (1024px+)

Full three-column layout
Large 3D canvas area
Side-by-side component demos

Tablet (768px - 1023px)

Two-column grid
Reduced 3D canvas size
Stacked component demos

Mobile (< 768px)

Single column layout
Minimal 3D effects for performance
Simplified particle system

Animation Strategy
Framer Motion Implementations
jsx// Section animations
const fadeInUp = {
initial: { opacity: 0, y: 60 },
animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOut" }
};

// Staggered component reveals
const staggerContainer = {
animate: {
transition: {
staggerChildren: 0.1
}
}
};
Performance Considerations

Lazy loading for 3D elements below fold
Reduced motion detection: prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
GPU acceleration for all animated elements
Intersection Observer for triggering animations

Content Strategy
Hero Headlines

Primary: "Beautiful Glassmorphism Components"
Secondary: "React components inspired by ZyFAi's sophisticated design system"
CTA: "npm install @zyfi/components"

Feature Messaging

"Modern Design" - Glassmorphism effects with accessibility built-in
"TypeScript First" - Fully typed components for better DX
"Production Ready" - Tested, documented, and optimized

Component Demonstrations

Interactive preview showing real component behavior
Code snippets with syntax highlighting
Copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy implementation

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEVELOPER
Create the complete ZyFAi Component Library landing page following the landing-page.md specifications with full responsive design and interactive features:

1. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei p5 @types/p5 react-syntax-highlighter
   ```

Create landing page structure in src/pages/LandingPage/ with files:

LandingPage.tsx (main page component)
components/HeroSection.tsx
components/Hero3DBackground.tsx (three.js implementation)
components/ParticleSystem.tsx (p5.js implementation)
components/ComponentShowcase.tsx
components/LiveDemo.tsx
components/FeatureGrid.tsx
components/InstallationSection.tsx
components/Footer.tsx
LandingPage.module.css
